# GQLr - The design system specifications for a graph-document database with a GQL-inspired query language

When I refer to a "database design system" I am referring to the data model, query language, and response objects that are used to implement the graph-document database.

I think I will start by creating a design specification for the ideal database (in my opinion), which uses human-centered design principles, instead of developing an actual database. This is similar to the GraphQL specification, which did not actually implement the ideas, but simply provided the rules that a GraphQL implementation was supposed to follow. Maybe I could open source these ideas and publish them on my personal website and get feedback and community contributions as I develop these ideas.

See the files in the `ideas` directory for more information. Look at my Chrome bookmark for "Computer Science" >> "Database Design" for more resources. 

I will add more notes to this file as I work on this project.

I want to create a Graph-Document database that has an intuitive GQL-inspired query language. Similar to SurrealDB, but better.

* I have had the hardest time trying to decide on a database that I like. I finally came to the conclusion that I should create my own database and query language.
* Written in Mojo.
* Graph database where each record is a document that can be infinitely nested.
* Simple and intuitive query language based on GQL. See the `QUERY_LANGUAGE.md` file for details.

Multi-modal databases do *not* seem to follow the principle of only one way to do things, so this database will not attempt to be multi-modal. However, I am pretty sure that graph databases can do everything that most, if not all, other databases can do. So this database should be able to handle most other use cases.

## Possible Names

The name should refer to the database design system (i.e. data model, query language, response object) that is used to implement a graph database (e.g. GQL, SQL) and not the database itself (e.g. Neo4j, Postgres).

* GQLr = GQL redesigned. This name would refer to my goal to redesign graph databases to use human-centered design in the data model, query language, and response objects.
* iGQL = *intuitive* Graph Query Language
* Quigley = GQL rearranged (and formed into a word or name). The name Quigley looks like the letters GQL rearranged and turned into a word (QuiGLey). This name might be less insulting.

# Quigley - GQL Middleware for FalkorDB

Quigley is a middleware for GQL that provides two things:

1. Schema validation. It will validate your GQL query against a schema that you define. After your GQL query is validated, then your query will be sent to the database.
2. Hierarchically formatted query results. Your query results will be formatted in a data structure that is GraphQL-like and that shows the relationships between the records that are returned.

There will also be a CLI that helps to automate schema migrations.

---

## Motivations

* I like how SurrealDB has an optional schema, which makes it easier when prototyping apps and testing ideas. But when you are ready to create production-level apps, you want a clearly-defined schema that everyone has to adhere to otherwise you could run into data integrity and/or data corruption issues. So I want to provide a similar "optional schema" feature for graph databases that use GQL.
* I want the schema to be validated during development and even in production. It might not be necessary to validate the schema in production if you have already been validating it during development, but the option is there if you need it.
* I want to have hierarchical data structures from my queries. Graph databases are great for showing the relationships between records (called nodes), but if the queries return results as a flat list of records with no relationships, then it feels like we are missing a huge part of what makes graph databases so awesome!
* If you have a schema, then you will have to deal with schema migrations. I want to create a Quigley CLI (qgly) that also helps to automate schema migrations.

## Testing the Code

### How to run the unit tests

This project uses Vitest as the test runner because it can be configured with type checking enabled, which will include a "Type Errors" line in the output.

### Run all the unit tests

```
bun run test
```

```
NOTE:

If you are using Bun as your package manager, make sure to use "bun run test" command instead of "bun test", otherwise Bun will run its own test runner.

See https://vitest.dev/guide/#writing-tests
```

### Filter tests

You can filter tests by adding the filename to the end of the test script in the `package.json` file. For example, `"vitest run --typecheck query-validator"`. Then run `bun run test`.

See [Test Filtering](https://vitest.dev/guide/filtering)

If any suites/tests are marked with `describe.only()`/`test.only()`, then only those suites/tests will run.

If any suites/tests are marked with `describe.skip()`/`test.skip()`, then those suites/tests will be excluded when you run `bun run test`.

See [Vitest API](https://vitest.dev/api/).


### How to run individual functions or the code in the `demo-project` directory

Look at the Makefile for some commands that can be used to run code in this project.

This project was created using the Bun runtime. You can follow the instruction on Bun's website to [install Bun on your computer](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

Using npm scripts: You can run the entire Quigley library with `bun` by running `bun run demo-project` from the project root directory.

## Language Support in VSCode

The syntax of a `.gqls` file is very similar to a GraphQL file (`gql`, `graphql`). You can even get syntax highlighting and some language support by associating `.gqls` files with `.gql` file types (at least until there is a official language support created for VSCode).

Open your `settings.json` file:

* Open the Command Palette with `Shift+Ctrl+P` (Linux/Windows) or `Shift+Command+P` (Mac).
* Search for `settings.json`.
* Select **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**.
* Create an entry for file associations:

```json
"files.associations": {
  "*.gqls": "gql"
}
```

You might need to rename your `schema.gqls` file to `schema.gql` (drop the "s" at the end of `gqls` and remember to press enter so the file actually gets renamed) and then rename it back to `schema.gqls` for the file association to take affect in VSCode.
