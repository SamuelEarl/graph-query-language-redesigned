# GQL Middleware Ideas

I want to create a GQL middleware for FalkorDB that uses these ideas:

1. Implement schema validation. See Mongoose.js (https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html).
  1. Maybe TigerGraph's schema definition has some ideas: [Defining a Graph Schema](https://docs.tigergraph.com/gsql-ref/4.1/ddl-and-loading/defining-a-graph-schema)
2. Automate schema migrations. I want to be able to apply changes to a database's schema and data as my web app evolves. So I am wondering how to do things like adding or removing nodes, edges, properties, or indexes, and modifying data types or constraints in the schema and in the data across the entire database. I want to know how to apply those changes while avoiding data loss or compatibility issues.
  1. Search for "how do database schema migrations work".
  2. For ideas on schema migrations, see:
    1. [Database Schema Migration (Schema Change)](https://www.liquibase.com/resources/guides/database-schema-migration)
    2. [Neo4j Schema Migrations?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53083183/neo4j-schema-migrations)
    3. [Updating all nodes in a graph](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35864406/updating-all-nodes-in-a-graph)
    4. [Neo4j-Migrations](https://neo4j.com/labs/neo4j-migrations/) is inspired largely by [Redgate Flyway](https://www.red-gate.com/products/flyway/community/).
  3. Could migrations be automated with a CLI?
    1. Maybe I could have a command like `qgly generate migration schema.v1.ts schema.v2.ts` that creates a diff of the two (versioned) schema files along with default values that should be inserted for new properties that are introduced into the schema. This could create a migration file with a name like this: `migration.to.schema.v2.ts`.
    2. Then I could have a command like `qgly apply migration migration.to.schema.v2.ts staging` that executes the migration against the specified database (which is "staging" in the previous example). Then I can run unit/integration/e2e tests in that environment.
    3. In the Quigley configs (qgly.config.ts) the user would then have to update the schema that is referenced so that queries do not throw validation errors. Or, better yet, that should be automated by the CLI with an alert to the user that the schema that is referenced in the config file will be updated to the newly migrated schema.
3. Uses GelDB's query language (formerly EdgeDB) as inspiration (e.g. schema declaration, query syntax, and hierarchical format of query results). See https://docs.geldata.com/.
4. (Maybe) Borrows ideas from Memgraph's GQLAlchemy library. See https://memgraph.com/memgraph-for-python-developers and https://github.com/memgraph/gqlalchemy/tree/main.
5. Borrow ideas from Drizzle ORM (e.g. type safety).
